This To-Do List application allows users to easily manage their tasks in a simple, user-friendly interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app stores tasks in the browserâ€™s localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even when the page is refreshed. The user can add tasks by typing them into an input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. Once added, tasks are displayed in an ordered list below the input field. The app retrieves all tasks from localStorage upon page reload, maintaining the list's continuity. This solution is ideal for small, personal task management without the need for server-side storage or complex frameworks.
